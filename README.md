Javascript Quiz

Found a good starter code which really helped me understand javasscript better and used jquery because I just understand that way better. 
css I am still kind of struggling with so I got help with the code for that as well.
Have been working on it since I have turned it in and I think I am gettting the hang of it so I haven't fully completed the criteria but I think I'm slowly understanding it.
